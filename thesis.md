Sometime in the early 2020s, the internet stopped being a place we visited and became the place we
live. The days of the internet being a refuge from the real world are gone; now, the real world is a refuge
from the internet. As algorithms took over our daily lives, specific groups found each other, forming digital
communities—TPOT, MusicTok, and ’Weird Catholicism,’ to name a few. These communities share the
same feeds and interact with the same content, bonding over key ideas before pushing them out to other
corners of the internet.
The fatal flaw of these subcultures is their inability to mobilize. Plagued by doctrinal inconsistencies and
a lack of leadership, they leave immense political and cultural capital on the table. Compare this to Effective
Altruism (EA), which successfully transitioned from a message board philosophy to a global institutional
force. The EA community aligned around quantifiable goals and established financial engines that allowed
them to have substantial say in technology, politics, and culture.
To replicate EA’s success, subcultures must adopt the same strategies and build an engine for growth.
The solution is a platform that places communities front and center. A place where the Key Opinion
Leaders (KOLs) of these groups can collaborate, define the rules, raise funds, and vote on how the group
should mobilize.
What I am proposing is a new technology that connects all of these. Let me walk you through how I
imagine this to work.
When someone creates a group—public or private—the platform automatically deploys a token tied to
that group. At the moment of creation, members gain access to a secure group-chat environment modeled
after Discord/Slack, but fully end-to-end encrypted. Inside this space, the group defines its purpose, norms,
and identity. Leadership emerges organically through reputation: consistent contribution, participation, and
output elevate a member’s standing, similar to the promotion mechanics in Clash of Clans.
Once the group has shaped its core identity, it publishes a charter on its public page—a clear articulation
of what it is trying to build: its documents, influences, goals, and people. Outsiders can now see the project
and, if they believe in it, they can buy the group’s token. For public groups, holding tokens confers voting
rights, proportional to one’s stake. For private groups, tokens are freely tradable but do not grant influence.
In both cases, tokens remain completely liquid: buyers and sellers transact against an automated bonding
curve or AMM pool, ensuring that people can enter or exit at any moment without waiting for a counterparty.
This gives every group an always-on market that reflects real-time belief in its trajectory.
The platform takes a small fee on each trade. Those fees accumulate into the group’s treasury. The
group then decides, through on-chain voting, how to deploy these resources. They might fund research, run
an event, back a political candidate, purchase equipment, reward members, or reinvest in the liquidity pool.
Whether the group is an AI research effort, a niche political coalition, or an experimental art scene, members
share their work-in-progress in the encrypted space while the public market prices their momentum.
The core idea is simple: online communities finally have a mechanism to mobilize, coordinate, and
accomplish real-world work.
This structure becomes especially important when viewed through the “Dark Forest” shift of the modern
internet. As the public web has turned into a performance layer dominated by advertising and algorithmic
incentives, real thinking has migrated into private chats, DM circles, and invite-only events. These hidden
spaces allow people to think freely, but they also fragment communities into isolated pockets with no shared
infrastructure, no way to coordinate, and no way to turn latent energy into action.
What’s missing is a protected environment where these dark-forest groups can articulate their identity,
pool resources, elect leaders, and act together—without exposing themselves to the chaos of public platforms.

A system that preserves the intimacy of small groups while giving them the tooling of a sovereign organization.
So what is the long-term vision for this project? What could result from this crazy idea?
I believe the political groups brewing online can gain traction and become something real, dethroning the
GOP and DNC. I believe this could be a solution for the mess that is scientific funding. I believe this could
grant freedom to thousands of new musicians and artists to pursue their best work. But more importantly,
this is a check against governments, big corporations, and those that seek to take away the freedom and
agency of ordinary person.
The web was meant for collaboration. This restores that promise with tools that are actually usable:
encrypted groups, liquid tokens, shared treasuries, and collective decision-making. It gives communities a
way to form, to fund their ideas, and to build influence—starting from the most fundamental social primitive
we have online: the group chat.
